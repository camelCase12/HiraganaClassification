# HiraganaClassification
Deep learning for japanese hiragana classification.

This project uses TensorFlow in python to build a convolutional neural network that can predict Japanese Hiragana labels (in romaji). 
A split dataset as well as code for creating an augmented model is included. There is also a report summarizing the development of the model.
